# Study of tradeoff methods for multi-fidelity datasets
###### Abstract
The application of multi-fidelity methods in scientific research has grown substantially, particularly within quantum chemistry. This repository contains the code and data used to conduct a thorough analysis of various multi-fidelity techniques within the realm of quantum chemistry.

###### Results
An increase in computational time with the use of more high-fidelity data.
Diminishing returns in prediction error metrics with increasing high-fidelity data.

###### Conclusion
The core strength of multi-fidelity modelling lies in its ability to synergize varying fidelity data, optimizing the balance between computational resource allocation and prediction precision.

###### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is qm7b.json, which is available for public download at https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Learning_Properties_of_Ordered_and_Disordered_Materials_from_Multi-fidelity_Data/13040330
